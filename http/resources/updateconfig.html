				<p><strong>Hello!</strong> It appears that you have not set up your configuration file, it could not be read, or the TLS certificate could not be loaded. A default config file has been generated for you if it did not exist already, but it still requires configuration. You may find the configuration file at &lt;installDir&gt;/configuration/config.json</p>
				<p>Otherwise, review the log output for more information on why the server failed to start. Once the config file has been updated, or the issue resolved, restart the application</p>
